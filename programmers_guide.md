# Programmer's Guide

Tech Stack: 
* Next.js
  #### Resources to learn and understand the structure of the code
    * https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app
    

React Frameworks:
* React Bootstrap
* Plotly: A react library that allows you to very simply create good looking graphs. By generating a list of x and y, it creates a very elegant line graph (or any type of graph). Documentation, including more advanced styling, can be found here: https://plotly.com/javascript/react/

Database:
* mongoDB
  #### Resources to learn and understand the structure of the code
    * https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/
    * https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-s20/project-idea-reviewer-nextjs/tree/master/pages
      
These first two resources give foundation for what our mongoDB connection is based on. From the project idea reviewer code we learned how to setup a connection the database in /utils/mongodb, and then in the /pages/api helped us create an API endpoint and call it within our code. The mongoDB tutorial teaches how to structure data to input into the database, creating the intuition necessary to populate your database.

    * https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update-field/
    
This was the most used page for us, but the entire mongoDB documentation in this manual is extremely well explained with detailed examples and code snippets to understand any code from our project involving mongoDB. This page contains field update operators that explain the behavior of the data that we're pushing into the database, such as incrementing, setting, or only setting a field when the document is inserted into the database.
  

Authentication:
* Auth0
  * We didn't go further than what was on the starter code in authentication.
