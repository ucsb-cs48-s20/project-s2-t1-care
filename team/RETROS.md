# Retro 04/20/20

- Led by: Cindy Zhao
- Present: Lina Zeng, Leron Reznikov, Julian Wong, Misha Obukhov
- Absent: none

## Action item

- a goal: getting familiarized and comfortable with next.js and the components that go with it such as MangoDB
- a change: better communication on when we would work on our projects so we can all work together efficiently
- a measurement: one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve our goal is by making sure everyone shows up to meetings on time; we should also have an app running (including login) by the end of this week.
- a stop: instead of just reading the tutorials, we should do some hands on coding following the tutorials

## Retro Assessment

- A brief description of what retro outline or process you used: I used the Start/Stop/Continue, where we identified which items we should stop doing, which items we should start doing, and which items we should continue.
- A brief assessment of how it went: I think it went fairly okay, we were able to identify the core issues we should focus on now and get rid of the things we found useless.
- What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?: Don't be afraid to speak out and lead the team!
