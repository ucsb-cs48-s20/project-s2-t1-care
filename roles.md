#### Julian

I primarily focused on the backend of the project. At the beginning, I spent most of my time learning how to create API endpoints, how to query the database, and how to push data into the database. I created the structure used by our form to push the plantLevel along with the user object, and then later provided support for the other members of my group when they wanted to implement something that involved the backend, such as changing settings or creating a history page listing previous entries made. Besides this, my other contributions were in a group setting, coding over liveshare, giving input on fixing bugs and reading documentation to help others while they were coding.

#### Leron

Initially, we all worked together to set the database up. I had a big role in getting the plant level to display in the front end, because that was one of the major issues we had early on. Later in the development process, I created the History tab of our website. It had two components: in one of them, I figured out how to use the plot.ly react library to graph the mood and sleep over time based on the journal entries. With the help of the team, I also created a component that listed the history of every journal entry. Otherwise, the majority of our teamâ€™s development was done while on a call together, and so most of the features were done synchronously.

#### Cindy

In the beginning, we all did the database together because it was a really big portion of our project. I worked on the frontend and backend connection because we were having a lot of trouble on it. Overall, we did most of our issues together where we had weekly Zoom meetings outside of class hours and we would help each other and do the iterations. I supported my team members in areas by helping them debug code. Later, I worked on Settings page where the user could input in their sleep goal. The sleep goal is entered into the database and used ask part of the equation to grow the plant. The goal is also displayed in the journal entries page to let the user know what their goal was when they enter their hours.

#### Lina

Overall, our team worked heavily together on almost every aspect during lectures, sections, and our consistent Zoom work sessions. Our collaborated contributions consisted of GitHub mishaps, testing, labs, any feature concerning database, and almost every other feature and QA. I individually contributed most to the frontend, setting the outline for our MVP with the journal form and plant display as well as displaying toasts indicating submission.

#### Misha

Many of our team members have been flexible and filled diverse roles throughout this project. For example, at the begining, I worked on finding how to make a plant that can grow on command and look good. This lead to me creating the first iteration of our plant gif component which we have worked off of heavily. Additionally, I have focused on the css of the webpage in order to make a pleasing design base to work off of. I have worked entirely on the frontend and also completed the storybook portion of our project.
