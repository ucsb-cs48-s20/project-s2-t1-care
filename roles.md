#### Julian
I primarily focused on the backend of the project for the majority of the project. At the beginning of the project, I spent most of my time learning how to create API endpoints, how to query the database, and how to push data into the database. I created the structure used by our form to push the plantLevel along with the user object, and then later provided support for the other members of my group when they wanted to implement something that involved the backend, such as changing settings or creating a history page listing previous entries made. Besides this, my other contributions were in a group setting, coding over liveshare, giving input on fixing bugs and reading documentation to help others while they were coding.

#### Leron
Initially, we all worked together to set the database up. I had a big role in getting the plant level to display in the front end, because that was one of the major issues we had early on. Later in the development process, I created the History tab of our website. It had two components: in one of them, I figured out how to use the plot.ly react library to graph the mood and sleep over time based on the journal entries. With the help of the team, I also created a component that listed the history of every journal entry. Otherwise, the majority of our teamâ€™s development was done while on a call together, and so most of the features were done synchronously.
