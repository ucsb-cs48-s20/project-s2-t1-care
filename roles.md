##### Julian
I primarily focused on the backend of the project for the majority of the project. At the beginning of the project, I spent most of my time learning how to create API endpoints, how to query the database, and how to push data into the database. I created the structure used by our form to push the plantLevel along with the user object, and then later provided support for the other members of my group when they wanted to implement something that involved the backend, such as changing settings or creating a history page listing previous entries made. Besides this, my other contributions were in a group setting, coding over liveshare, giving input on fixing bugs and reading documentation to help others while they were coding.
